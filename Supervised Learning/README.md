### Datasets
I chose to implement each algorithm on simple datasets loaded from Seaborn and Scikit-learn, 
so that I could focus on learning the nuances of each algorithm. 



I primarily use the penguins dataset, which can be loaded with the following

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.load_dataset('penguins')
```

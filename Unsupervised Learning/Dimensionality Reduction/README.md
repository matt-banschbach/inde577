# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
___
### Overview 

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to simplify complex datasets while preserving essential information. Here's an explanation of PCA, including its mathematical foundation, benefits, limitations, and applications:

##### Mathematical Foundation

PCA transforms a set of correlated variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The process involves:

1. Centering the data by subtracting the mean.
2. Computing the covariance matrix.
3. Calculating eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
4. Selecting principal components based on eigenvalues.

Mathematically, PCA can be expressed as:

$$X = U\Sigma V^T$$

Where:
- X is the original data matrix
- U and V are orthogonal matrices containing left and right singular vectors
- Î£ is a diagonal matrix of singular values

##### Benefits

1. Dimensionality reduction: PCA reduces the number of variables while retaining most of the information, 
simplifying data analysis and visualization.
2. Feature selection: It helps identify the most important variables in a dataset, 
which is useful in machine learning applications.
3. Noise reduction: By removing principal components with low variance, PCA can improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
4. Data compression: PCA can reduce storage requirements and speed up processing by representing data using fewer 
principal components.
5. Multicollinearity handling: It creates uncorrelated variables, addressing issues in regression analysis where 
independent variables are highly correlated.

##### Limitations

1. Interpretation challenges: Principal components are linear combinations of original variables, making 
them difficult to interpret in terms of the original features.
2. Data scaling sensitivity: PCA is sensitive to the scale of input variables, 
requiring proper data normalization before application.
3. Information loss: Reducing dimensionality inevitably leads to some information loss, which depends on the 
number of principal components retained.
4. Assumption of linearity: PCA assumes linear relationships between variables, which may not hold for all datasets.
5. Outlier sensitivity: PCA results can be significantly affected by outliers in the dataset.
6. Limited to continuous data: PCA is not suitable for categorical or discrete variables.

## Applications

1. Data visualization: PCA enables the plotting of high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions, 
making it easier to interpret patterns.
2. Image compression: PCA can be used to resize images and reduce storage requirements.
3. Finance: It's applied in analyzing stock data and forecasting returns.
4. Biology and medicine: PCA is used in neuroscience for spike-triggered covariance analysis and in other biological 
data analysis tasks.
5. Pattern recognition: PCA helps identify patterns in high-dimensional datasets across various fields.
6. Feature extraction: It's used to extract relevant features from complex datasets for further analysis or 
machine learning tasks.

### Datasets

The following datasets are used:
- penguins
- wine

which can be implemented as follows:

Penguins:
```python
import seaborn as sns
penguins = sns.load_dataset('penguins')
```

Wine:
```python
from em_el.datasets import load_wine
wine = load_wine()
```
